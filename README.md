Practice: Big Spenders
Doris leans forward in her seat, eyes bright, and exclaims, "I don't know why I didn't hire someone earlier. This is making my job so much easier!" She starts to scroll through all of the businesses in your Active Customers report, clearly enjoying her new toy.

After several minutes of this, she abruptly stops and turns her head quickly in your direction, eyes wide. "You know, my regional manager, Barry has been asking me for something for months now. He wants me to produce a report for him that list only the companies that have placed an order for more than nine thousand dollars."

Use the filter method to get all the big spenders in the main array into a new one.

------------------------Starter code ------------------------------
// Array to contain all the big spenders
const bigSpenders = businesses.filter(business => {
